		<h2>Why I think I would be a good future developer</h2>
		<p> Firstly, as a woman in the tech industry, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Historically, the tech
			industry has been male-dominated, but as more women enter the field, we are able to bring new ideas and
			approaches to problem-solving. Diversity in tech is crucial to creating inclusive and innovative products,
			and I am excited to contribute to this movement. </p>
		<p> Secondly, I have a natural curiosity and passion for learning, which is essential in the field of web
			development. I am constantly seeking out new resources and ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I
			believe that this drive and determination will enable me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends
			and advancements. </p>
		<p> Additionally, I am a creative problem-solver and have experience in working collaboratively in teams. These
			skills are essential in the field of web development, as projects often involve working with designers,
			project managers, and other developers. I am confident that my ability to communicate effectively and work
			well with others will be an asset to any team. </p>
		<p> Lastly, I am dedicated to creating user-friendly and accessible web experiences. I believe that the web
			should be an inclusive space for all users, regardless of their background or abilities. As a web developer,
			I aim to prioritize user experience and ensure that all users can access and enjoy the websites and
			applications that I create. </p>

		<h2>Introduce myself</h2>
		<p> My name is Dan Sun, originally from China, but now living in Stockholm for almost a
			decade. I was a music teacher in China, and now a kindergarten teacher in Stockholm after completing my
			second bachelor's degree from Stockholm University. Although I have found purpose in these careers, my heart
			has always been drawn towards the limitless possibilities of technology.

			doubts from many of my friends. But I know in my heart that this is where I am meant to be, and luckily, my
			family has been incredibly supportive of my decision. </p>

			self-study. I am now eager to take the next step in my learning journey and participate in a comprehensive
			training program that can offer me the depth and breadth of knowledge necessary to become a successful web
			developer. </p>
		<p> The reason why I am particularly drawn to this program is that it offers a well-rounded education in the
			front-end development, espeically target for the women. I really like the idea of IT for women. Additionally, the opportunity to learn from experienced
			professionals in the field and collaborate with other passionate students is something that excites me
			greatly.

		program. I am ready to embrace new challenges and develop my skills to their fullest potential. With the
		knowledge and experience gained through this program, I am determined to make a meaningful contribution to the
		industry and society as a whole.
